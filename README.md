### Configuration üîß
- Create a local_settings.py file in the project directory.
- Add your API keys, temperature settings for the GPT models, and the path for the - transcriptions to the local_settings.py file:

```python
YOUTUBE_API_KEY = "Your_Youtube_API_Key" #needed only if you use the video scraper
OPENAI_API_KEY = "Your_OpenAI_API_Key"
COHERE_API_KEY = "Your_Cohere_API_Key" #needed for the embeddings
DATA_PATH = "Your_pathname"
CHAT_MODEL_TEMPERATURE = 0.0 #temprature if using GPT3
GPT_4_TEMPERATURE = 0.0
```
Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual API keys. Keep the local_settings.py file secure and do not share it with others.

### Running InsightFlow üöÄ
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the InsightFlow project directory.
- Run the run.py script:
```bash
python run.py
```
You will be prompted to choose which module to run (doc_scraping, transcribe, or chat). Follow the prompts to provide the required information for the chosen module.

### Running the documentation scraper üìë
Run the run.py script and choose the "doc_scraping" module.
You will be prompted to enter the URL of the API documentation. The script will parse the HTML, clean the text, and save the cleaned markdown as a .txt file in the current directory.

### Running the YouTube Video Scraper üìπ
Run the run.py script and choose the "transcribe" module.
You will be prompted to provide either a YouTube video ID or a file containing a list of YouTube video IDs, one per line.
The script will download the YouTube videos, transcribe the audio, and save the transcriptions to the data/transcripts directory.

### Running the Chat Module üó£Ô∏è
Run the run.py script and choose the "chat" module.
- Provide the file directories (it will take all .txt files)
- Choose if you want to translate source documents (it may improve Q&A performance and allow for more context window because of better tokenization)
